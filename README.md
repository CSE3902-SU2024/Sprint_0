## Working

### Link 
Will and Carter worked primarily on the implementation of Link, our player class.This was done for the functionality check
in in such a way that we realized it would be best moving forward to completely wipe it and doing it differently. What you see in Sprint 2 is our updated implementations.

### Items
Cen gu worked primarily on items, not having many issues or changes.

### Blockes
Ben eskobar worked on our blocks classes

### Enemies
Hengkai worked on the enemy class, adding many enemies with different movement patterns and attack patterns.
