Enemy.cs Hengkai

Hengkai use list to load different enemies from different sprite sheets which is a good way to solve the problem about there are different boss on the different sheet and use enum to check the status of the enemies which cause each enemy has its own moving and attacking patterns but it cause the LoadContent to become too complicated to load it
