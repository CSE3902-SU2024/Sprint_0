Reviewing AnimatedBlock.cs

Overall I like the implementation of the animated blocks and how the class  is kept pretty short.
The one bit that I'm not totally a fan of is keeping the blocks as an array and the fact that not 
every block has its own class.
I think in the future we're going to have to create individual classes for each block type and 
then have another class to handle when and where those blocks are being displayed.
In the future I think it may be a good Idea to also have a seperate sprite helper to create all of the block rectangles.
