Hengkai Zheng Code Review for item.cs

The Item.cs class effectively handles item movement, animation, and state management, 
with a clear distinction between attackable and unattackable items using an enum.
However, it could benefit from improvements such as encapsulating fields like Sprite and SourceRectangles with properties,
removing unused imports, and adding null checks for SourceRectangles to avoid potential errors.
